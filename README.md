The present implementation takes as base the paxos skeleton provided by the TAs, and operates over it. Our implementation 
of Paxos can be found under the `real_paxos` folder. It has the same file structure as the `fake_paxos` original folder, and most
of our implementation can be found in the `paxos.py` file.

The command to run our implementation, given you are in the project folder, is the following:
```bash
./run.sh real_paxos 500
```
